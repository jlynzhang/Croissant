      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
        but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their
        historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a
        layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled
        and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet,
        in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
        flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
        crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long
        been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries.
        The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the
        late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but
        unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by
        unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie
        chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of
        2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries
        were baked from frozen dough.

        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
        countries.
